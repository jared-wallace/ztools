.SH NAME 
zvim \- open in vim a raw zlib compressed file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zvim
.I file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B zvim
is essentially a wrapper around a clever hack to decompress raw zlib compressed files.
Using tar, zip or even gzip to uncompress such a file will fail. The actual hack prepends
the gzip header to the raw file, and then passes that entire mess into gzip, with the output
redirected into vim. The utility is limited - you cannot open more than one file, and you
also cannot pass any options into vim at this time.
